# 🐍 Python Skill Development Portfolio

This repository documents my self-study and practice as I learn and master the Python programming language. The structure separates the main learning files for core concepts from the corresponding practice set solutions.

## 📚 Current Learning Status

I have successfully completed the foundational data types and fundamental programming concepts, progressing up to and including the **Strings** chapter.

| Chapter | Topic | Status | Code Location | Practice Set Location |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Modules, Comments, and Basics | ✅ Completed | `Chapter_01_Basics/` | `Chapter_01_PS/` |
| **2** | Variables and Data Types | ✅ Completed | `Chapter_02_Data_Types/` | `Chapter_02_PS/` |
| **3** | Strings and Text Processing | ✅ Completed | `Chapter_03_Strings/` | `Chapter_03_PS/` |
| **4** | Lists & Tuples (Sequences) | ⏳ In Progress | `Chapter_04_Lists_Tuples/` | `Chapter_04_PS/` |
| **5** | Dictionaries & Sets | 🗓️ Planned | N/A | N/A |
| **6** | Conditional Statements (if-else) | 🗓️ Planned | N/A | N/A |

## 📁 Repository Structure

The main logic files for the core concepts are kept in topic-specific folders (`Chapter_XX_Topic/`), and all solutions to exercises and chapter-end problems are in separate, corresponding folders (`Chapter_XX_PS/`).

## ✨ Key Concepts Covered So Far (Chapter 3: Strings)

The focus of my practice in the string chapters includes:

* **String Definition and Slicing:** Creating strings and accessing substrings using both positive and negative indices, including advanced slicing techniques. 
* **Immutability:** Understanding that Python strings are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
* **String Methods:** Practical application of built-in methods for text manipulation (e.g., `.upper()`, `.replace()`, `.find()`, `.split()`).
* **Formatting and Control:** Using advanced formatting techniques (like f-strings) and escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`) for structured output.

## 🚀 Next Steps

The next steps will focus on mastering complex data structures and control flow:

* **Chapter 4:** Mastering Lists (mutable, ordered collection) and Tuples (immutable, ordered collection).
* **Chapter 5:** Working with Dictionaries (key-value pairs) and Sets (unique, unordered elements).
* **Control Flow:** Implementing logic and decision-making using conditional (`if-else`) statements and loops.
